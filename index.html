<h2>GraveRobber skills</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Spirit Mending</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your unnatural luck and affinity for the
energies of life allow you to bring people back from the brink
of death. When an ally within 5 feet of you is below half their
hit point maximum, you can use your action to pour healing
energy into them. The target recovers hit points equal to your
rogue level + your Charisma modifier. If the target has been
reduced to 0 hit points, they recover half as many hit points
instead. Once a creature has been healed by this feature, it
can’t be targeted again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Soul Thief</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn to steal the life essence of your enemies,
and your connection to the grave grants you incredible power.
Whenever you or an undead you control kills a creature with
an Intelligence score of 6 or greater, you can choose to harvest
a fraction of your victim’s soul, binding it into a small object
you keep about your person, such as a gemstone, doll, or
weapon. Each object can contain only one such soul at a time.
As a bonus action, you can choose to unleash one of these
enslaved spirits to do your bidding, freeing it from the item.
If the spirit was bound to a weapon, you summon a ghostly
version of the weapon and use it to make a melee weapon
attack with a 15-foot reach. This attack deals force damage.
After the attack is made, the ethereal weapon vanishes.
If the spirit was bound to any other item, its release opens
a small, shadowy rift to the Graveyard through the Ethereal
Plane. You can teleport to a location that you can see within 10
+ 5 times your Charisma modifier (minimum 10) feet of you.
Whenever you finish a long rest, your powerful soul calls
to the Graveyard, bringing forth a number of spirits for you
to bind equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The
maximum number of spirits you can have bound at once is
equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum 2).
You can choose to release a spirit without effect at any time
to make space for a new one.</p>
